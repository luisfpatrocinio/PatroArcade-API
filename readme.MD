# PatroArcade API

PatroArcade is the backend server for an online arcade system, developed as part of a TCC (undergraduate thesis) project. This API manages arcade information, connected players, and their save data, providing a robust platform for online arcade experiences.

## Features

- **Arcade Management:** Handles data for multiple arcades, including game lists and arcade info.
- **Player Management:** Registers, authenticates, and tracks players, including login/logout and user profiles.
- **Save Data:** Stores and retrieves player save data for games.
- **Leaderboards:** Manages and displays high scores and rankings.
- **News & Updates:** Provides news endpoints for arcade announcements.
- **Rate Limiting:** Middleware to protect endpoints from abuse.

## Technologies

- **Node.js** with **TypeScript**
- **Express.js** for HTTP server and routing
- **SQLite** (via `database.db`) for persistent storage
- **TypeORM** for database management
- **RESTful API** design
